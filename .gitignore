# Bower files
# We include bower.json only and not bower components as grunt will handle module installs
# for bower components first. Grunt will then do other tasks as needed with these files such
# as concat/compass. Empty bower_components folder is not ignored as this is the root and is 
# referenced in bower installs/grunt tasks and .bowerrc
src/global/bower_components/**

# Node module timestamps
node_modules/**

# Ignore folders inside build directory. Not ingoring dist itself as we reference the root 
# folder in grunt tasks
dist/**

# CSS
# Not ignoring other CSS files as we may be using Bower components
# that have CSS files which are updated on "bower install" so will need to 
# commmit these to the repository
